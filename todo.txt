TO-DO:

- send-prop with multiple properties, in order. -> sendAs is repeated for every property if not declared ?
- send-to with multiple targets, in order
- send-on with multiple events, in order

- on-receive with async function

- send property that encapsulates all send-xxx?
  send="data-href|click|main|text"

    but what about send-element? Use {} to encapsulate the query selector?
      send="{#foo}|click|main"

      send="props OR {element}|actions|targets|format"

- form - offer support to send-as="json"

- on-mutate ?

- http-post-json
- http-put-json
- http-patch-json
- http-delete

- headers
  - e.g.: headers="{ 'X-Foo': 'Bar' }"
