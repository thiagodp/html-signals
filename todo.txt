TO-DO:

- send-prop with multiple properties, in order.
    -> send-as is repeated for every property if not declared ?
    -> send-to with more than one element receive all the properties, or the properties in order?
- send-on with multiple events, in order

- on-receive with async function

- send property that encapsulates all send-xxx?
  send="data-href|click|main|text"

    but what about send-element? Use {} to encapsulate the query selector?
      send="{#foo}|click|main"

      send="props OR {element}|actions|targets|format"

- form - offer support to send-as="json" method="..."

  <form method="PUT action="..." send-as="json" > ?
