  OK- boolean
  - date
  - time
  - iso-date

OK- include fetchOptions in register()'s options

- include fetch timeout in fetchOptions

- send-prop with multiple properties, in order.

OK- headers for all http-related properties

OK- send property that encapsulates all send-xxx?
  send="data-href|click|main|text"

    but what about send-element? Use {} to encapsulate the query selector?
      send="{#foo}|click|main"

      send="props OR {element}|actions|targets|format"

OK- form - offer support to send-as="json" method="..."

  <form method="PUT action="..." send-as="json" > ?
