  - "fetch-html"
  - "fetch-json"
  - "fetch-text"
  - "element"
  - "element-clone"

## Notes

- `send-what` and `send-element` must not be used together.
- When `"element-clone"` references a `<template>` tag, it will clone the template's content.

## Limitations

- JSON content in element properties must have unquoted or single-quoted properties (HTML limitation)
  - ex.: `<span data-todo="{ title: 'Buy coffee', completed: false }" ></span>`
  - ex.: `<span data-todo="{ 'title': 'Buy coffee', 'completed': false }" ></span>`
- `$history` must be at the beginning or at the end of "send-to"
